My project consist of 2 parts:

## SEEING

### Part A

This is a continuation of the sine study from assignment c. I am very intrigued by the complexity that comes from a simple concept of using sine waves to move a certain object in a controlled pattern. In part A, a large part consist of using circles or spheres and allowing the sine wave to regulate its reduction and expansion. the line details within this sphere creates complex patterns. This is also accompanied by the movement of the POV, to allow the audience to enter and experience the sphere not just from a 1-dimensional outside view, but also from within the sphere itself rotating on the x,y,z axis. 

The sphere is accompanied by a box that tries to contain it but is also controlled by the sine wave cause it to weave within and out of the sphere's perimeters. 

For both of this objects, they are accompanied by fast glitches representing disorder and the desire to break away from repetition. 

This is what's seen. 


### Part B

Part B deals with the idea of the unseen. Sound waves, glitches, ideas, they exist and yet 90% of the time we don't see them. Only a handful of great ideas and sounds eventually get to be realised. 

The linear representation of these glitches represent the countless and continuous waves of ideas that run through the human mind and are yet unseen and unrealised. The boxes represent reflection and generalisation. 

As the music progresses, the drum and synth element becomes stronger, so does the presences of the boxes. In Part A we use these boxes to contain the sphere, in Part B the music corresponds to the boxes which corresponds to how we try to box up our ideas until they eventually become too huge and released into reality. 

The lines and boxes uses a minim library to react to the amplitude of the music.
